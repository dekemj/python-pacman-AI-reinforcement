# python-pacman-AI-reinforcement
Code for CSS 382, a class teaching AI using Python and Pac Man. As part of school policy, I've kept this repository private. Not doing so would be a violation of academic integrity policies. This particular repository contains the code for the first project, codign algorithms for a search AI.

Only specific algorithms within valueIterationAgents.py, qlearningAgents.py, and analysis.py were coded by me. The rest of the code was provided by the course.
